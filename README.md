# Reel-Talk

# Project Overview
The problem is sometimes people just donâ€™t know what to watch, the average person spends around 23 minutes a day trying to find something to watch. Over a span of 80 years a person will have wasted 1.3 years of their life trying to something they like to watch. With this web application users will spend less time looking for something to watch because they can search for movies that are now playing, upcoming, popular, and by title. Users will also be able to do the same thing for TV shows. Users will be able to view details about movies and tv shows, details like the genre, rating, plot, etc. The website will also have a section where registered users can write reviews about a movie or tv show and they can search what other people think about certain movies or shows. I feel that sometimes its better to get an opinion about a movie or tv show from a regular person instead of a critic because the reviews are more genuine.
